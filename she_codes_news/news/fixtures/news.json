Designers toyed with different-sized front and back wheels, the addition of chains and cranks and pedals, and tested a slew of braking mechanisms.\r\n\r\nBy the 1890s, America was totally obsessed with the bicycle—which by then looked pretty much like the ones we ride today. There were millions of bikes on the roads and a new culture built around the technology. People started \"wheelmen\" clubs and competed in races. They toured the country and compared tricks and stunts.\r\n\r\nThe craze was meaningful, especially, for women. Both Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton are credited with declaring that \"woman is riding to suffrage on the bicycle,\" a line that was printed and reprinted in newspapers at the turn of the century. The bicycle took \"old-fashioned, slow-going notions of the gentler sex,\" as The Courier (Nebraska) reported in 1895, and replaced them with \"some new woman, mounted on her steed of steel.\" And it gave women a new level of transportation independence that perplexed newspaper columnists across the country. From The San Francisco Call in 1895:\r\n\r\nIt really doesn't matter much where this one individual young lady is going on her wheel. It may be that she's going to the park on pleasure bent, or to the store for a dozen hairpins, or to call on a sick friend at the other side of town, or to get a doily pattern of somebody, or a recipe for removing tan and freckles. Let that be as it may. What the interested public wishes to know is, Where are all the women on wheels going? Is there a grand rendezvous somewhere toward which they are all headed and where they will some time hold a meet that will cause this wobbly old world to wake up and readjust itself?\r\n\r\nLets hope so :)\r\n\r\nWords and image shamelessly stolen from: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-technology-craze-of-the-1890s-that-forever-changed-womens-rights/373535/", "image_url": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lbEf-zoIBETCrYl7JQQhf3H3EeM=/0x107:1024x683/976x549/media/img/mt/2017/11/gettyimages_646271390_toned_1024/original.jpg", "favorites": []}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Women’s Bikes: An Intersectional Look at the History of Women and their Bicycles", "author": 3, "pub_date": "2023-07-23T09:07:00Z", "content": "In an 1896 interview with famed journalist Nellie Bly, suffragist Susan B. Anthony said, “Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. It makes her feel as if she were independent. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can’t get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.”\r\n\r\nThe bicycling craze of the 1890s had a profound impact on the rights and roles of women in American society. But attributing the emancipation of women to a humble two-wheeled spoked machine gives an instrument of technology too much credit. The bicycle did not usher in a new era of women’s rights; instead, brave women used bicycles as a tool, claiming the machine and public space for themselves and one another. Even today, the bicycle becomes a vehicle of liberation for communities who are marginalized.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle did not usher in a new era of women’s rights; instead, brave women used bicycles as a tool, claiming the machine and public space for themselves and one another.\r\n\r\nFrom: https://www.kittelson.com/ideas/womens-bikes-an-intersectional-look-at-the-history-of-women-and-their-bicycles/", "image_url": "https://www.kittelson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1280px-Women_Repairing_Bicycle_c._1895.jpg", "favorites": []}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Annie “Londonderry” Kopchovsky", "author": 3, "pub_date": "2023-07-23T09:10:00Z", "content": "In 1894, Annie “Londonderry” Kopchovsky was not unlike most 19th-century women. A Jewish immigrant, a 23-year-old mother of three, and a dutiful housewife, Kopchovsky was neither a cyclist nor an advocate for women’s rights. But when two men made an alleged bet that no woman could encircle the globe on a bicycle while earning $5,000 along the way, Kopchovksy took up the challenge.\r\n\r\nLeaving from Boston in full skirts on a 42-pound Columbia bicycle, Kopchovsky set out to prove to the world that women were not only physically and mentally strong, but fully capable of providing for themselves in a man’s world. She carried advertising placards on her bicycle and on her person to earn money on the journey, and even adopted the surname Londonderry as a contract with the Londonderry Lithia Spring Water company. She bicycled through Europe and North Africa and sailed on to the South Pacific before returning to the states through San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWhen she rolled into Boston 15 months later, Londonderry was a new woman. Clad in bloomers and physically transformed, Londonderry went on to become a vocal – and popular – advocate for both cycling and women’s rights. The New York World remarked in 1895 that her trip was “the most extraordinary journey ever undertaken by a woman,” leaving an immeasurable impact on the attitudes about women – and of women – at that day.\r\n\r\nFrom: https://momentummag.com/three-women-changed-course-history-bicycle/", "image_url": "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/564cab17e4b0351eec853796/1615248873818-668BJBDJQ0TFQ8YQ4LSA/bicycle-tintype-21.jpg", "favorites": []}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Breaking the Cycle: the Kittie Knox story", "author": 4, "pub_date": "2023-07-23T09:13:46Z", "content": "In a society that largely relies on motor vehicles for transportation, or even for sport, it may seem difficult to understand why it was so monumental for a plucky twenty-year-old woman to be allowed to participate in bicycle races, meets and other activities involving the sport. However, what transpired between the young woman and many cycling critics would prove to be a landmark in both the history of gender and racial issues.  \r\n\r\nKittie Knox’s story of courage in the face of racial tension helped desegregate the world of cycling and offered a hopeful vision for a future that accepts and supports diversity. Kittie is featured in several cycling journals held by the Smithsonian Libraries, such as the aforementioned The Referee and Cycle Trade Journal and The Bearings. Both journals can be found in the Smithsonian Libraries’ Digital Library.

If they expended energy in physical activity, they'd run the risk of [being infertile] or having weak children\".\r\n\r\nIt did not matter if women were riding for pleasure or necessity, the action of riding a bicycle was seen as improper for women, and — worryingly for men — it gave them freedom to travel independently.\r\n\r\n\"There was a lot of fear about it because suddenly women could just disappear up the street without chaperones and control,\" Ms Hunter said.\r\n\r\nBut in the WA goldfields the records show there was some tolerance for female cyclists, like Cissie Colreavy, who competed in races.\r\n\r\n\"Often, when women did try and race, the reports would be really derisory and making fun of them, and just trying to shame them out of doing it,\" Ms Hunter said.\r\n\r\nBut in the West Australian press, reporting on Ms Colreavy's bike racing was \"quite respectful\".\r\n\r\n\"Kalgoorlie was off the charts. It had the biggest bicycle path network in the world,\" Ms Hunter said.\r\n\r\nIn the hyper mobile world we (normally) live in, it is hard to fathom the impact the bicycle had for Europeans hell-bent on colonising the harsh environment of WA's gold country — the traditional lands of several Aboriginal nations.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle was faster than walking and more accessible to the working class than coaches.\r\n\r\nIn the Goldfields, bicycle couriers were the main means of communication, helping prospectors get their claims recognised.\r\n\r\n\"If you made a claim you had to get that claim pegged as soon as possible before others rushed in,\" Ms Hunter said.\r\n\r\nIn the Goldfields, as in many parts of Australia, the bicycle remained a vital form of transport for decades — its impact on people's lives cannot be underestimated.\r\n\r\n\"The bicycle changed men's lives, but it did the same for women plus 10, because they were under more restrictions to start with,\" Ms Hunter said.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-13/women-cyclists-outback-australia-bicycle-boom/12213054\r\n\r\nhttps://awiderworld.net/2020/05/13/389/", "image_url": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e753291f5e2be3d6b1c1c8773c3fe84d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=538&cropW=809&xPos=26&yPos=82&width=862&height=575", "favorites": []}}, {"model": "news.newsstory", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Tillie Anderson", "author": 2, "pub_date": "2023-07-23T09:30:09Z", "content": "Anderson was originally born in Sweden but emigrated to Chicago at the age of 14 where her passion for cycling began.
